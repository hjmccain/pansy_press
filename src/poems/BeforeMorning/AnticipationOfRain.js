        <b>Anticipation of Rain</b><br />
        <br />
        Why am I writing of rain<br />
        when I have been thinking<br />
        only of you? The rain<br />
        has not flooded my body â€” it is you<br />
        who dampens me hotly.<br />
        <br />
        Yet you share with the rain<br />
        a certain spareness in your gestures,<br />
        a certain remove of your intimacy.<br />
        <br />
        For though I come out drenched<br />
        and changed, I am still<br />
        solitary. Now under a blue sky.
