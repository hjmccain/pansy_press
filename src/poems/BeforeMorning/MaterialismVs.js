        <b>Materialism vs.</b><br />
        <br />
        Apparently a painting is not a satisfactory answer,<br />
        so at some point, someone answered the question of why<br />
        with an equation. I&#x2019;m as guilty as anyone,<br />
        scribbling notes in the margin about time and heat,<br />
        imagining that we are hurtling stretching breaking toward<br />
        a space - time that will be real, the neither - nor,<br />
        the purity —<br />
        <br />
        still, I cried all the way home from Silver City.<br />
        This wasn&#x2019;t the polished vulnerability of avatars —<br />
        it was the real stuff, sticky with snot.<br />
        <br />
        And though there are those among us who imagine all<br />
        the unanswered questions of the body could be explained,<br />
        if only they would add up,<br />
        <br />
        the philosopher said that perhaps God didn&#x2019;t think we would get this far.<br />
        Left the details vague, the way the painter gestures at the figure<br />
        with just a few strokes of ochre.<br />
        <br />
        *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br />
        <br />
        So, repeat what you said to me, about wanting to be alone.<br />
        Repeat it until it loses all meaning.<br />
        I want to hear the sounds, tongue pushed against teeth,<br />
        the quiet exhalations of trees pulled into your lungs,<br />
        breath formed into something more than it was,<br />
        alone merely the next shape the air takes,<br />
        indifferent to the ways we strain to define it.</p>
