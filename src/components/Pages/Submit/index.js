        Hi! If you're interested in submitting to Pansy Press, please read the
        submission guidelines &#38; info below. If everything looks good, go ahead and submit.
        We're excited to read your work!<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>INFO</h3>
        <br />
        For now, we are currently <b>only</b> publishing chapbook-length works by Tucson-based or Tucson-affiliated poets.
        You should submit if you (1) have 15-35 pages of poetry and (2) you either live in Tucson, used to live
        in Tucson, or have a particular connection with Tucson.<br />
        <br />
        We welcome all submissions that fit these criteria, and we especially encourage BIPOC, LGBTQ+, and other often underrepresented folks to apply.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
